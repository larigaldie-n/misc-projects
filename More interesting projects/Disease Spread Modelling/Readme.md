## Disease Spread Modelling

Outputs a quick visualization showing how a vaccine that "only" reduces the chance to catch/spread the disease (without entirely negating it), and "only" reduces the chance to die from it has serious health benefits on the entire population.

Loosely based on Conway's Game Of Life. Thanks Mahesh Venkitachalam for bits and pieces of code I reused!
