Several .csv files from a hospital comparison website. The general project aim was to program a few functions to decide, according to your US state, which hospital has the best results according to different outcomes

### First part was to code a function to find the best hospital in a given state for a given problem

Possible problems were "heart attack", "heart failure" or "pneumonia". Hospitals were rated according to a death rate on these outcomes

### Second part builds up on that and allows the user to look for a specific rank (including "best" or "worst")

### Third part builds up on that again and just gives the same results, this time for every state
